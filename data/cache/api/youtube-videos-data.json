No one to laugh with, no one to share the view, just me, the road, and my camera.\n\nIn this cinematic travel film, I take you with me through southern Patagonia—from the iconic granite horns of Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, to the jagged spires of Mount Fitz Roy in El Chaltén, Argentina. \n\nWhether you’re planning your own trip to Patagonia, dreaming of solo travel adventures, or just here for the views—I hope this story helps you feel a little more okay with not having all the answers. Thanks for being here.\n\n--\n\nFilmed solo on the Sony FX3. \nColor graded with my Endura Tone LUTs: www.kylekotajarvi.com/luts\n\n--\n\nMy cinema camera: https://amzn.to/4imtSC3\nMy travel tripod: https://amzn.to/4k49yqQ\nThe best tool for filming yourself: https://amzn.to/3Xszy5V\n\n--\n\nMusic via Musicbed.
