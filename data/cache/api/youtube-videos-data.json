So I truly hope you enjoy the video and please let me know if you prefer this vlog style or my previous cinematic videos and if you have any potential feedback. Anyways I had a blast putting together this video and exploring Dubai together with Visit Dubai.

Not because I didn’t want to go—but because I wasn’t sure how I’d handle being truly alone. No one to laugh with, no one to share the view, just me, the road, and my camera.\n\nIn this cinematic travel film, I take you with me through southern Patagonia—from the iconic granite horns of Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, to the jagged spires of Mount Fitz Roy in El Chaltén, Argentina. \n\nWhether you’re planning your own trip to Patagonia, dreaming of solo travel adventures, or just here for the views—I hope this story helps you feel a little more okay with not having all the answers. Thanks for being here.\n\n--\n\nFilmed solo on the Sony FX3. \n\n--\n\nMy cinema camera: https://amzn.to/4imtSC3\nMy travel tripod: https://amzn.to/4k49yqQ\nThe best tool for filming yourself: https://amzn.to/3Xszy5V\n\n--\n\nMusic via Musicbed.

From glacier lagoons and volcanic highlands to puffin cliffs and the world’s loneliest house in the Westman Islands, this was a trip about more than just capturing beautiful visuals. It was a personal checkpoint. A chance to slow down, reconnect with photography with the Sony A7R V, and reflect on where I’ve been - and where I’m going.\n\nAlong the way, I revisited familiar places like Vestrahorn and Skogafoss, explored hidden gems like Sigöldugljúfur (the Valley of Tears), and experienced the surreal beauty of Langisjór from the sky.\n\nFilmed solo on the Sony FX3. \n\n--\n\nMy cinema camera: https://amzn.to/4imtSC3\nThe Sony A7R V: https://tinyurl.com/SA7RV\nMy travel tripod: https://amzn.to/4k49yqQ\nThe best tool for filming yourself: https://amzn.to/3Xszy5V\nCampervan Rental: https://campeasy.com/\n\n--\n\nMusic via Musicbed.

In July 2024 we spent four weeks bikepacking two loops - one in the Cordillera Blanca and one in the Cordillera Huayuash of Peru.  We only slept below 3,000m on two occasions, crossing many  4,000m + passes - the highest at just under 4,900m (16,000ft).  We camped under snow capped peaks, hiked our bikes up breath taking hills and rode descents that lasted for hours.\n\nIf you like this film from Peru, please like, subscribe or comment.
